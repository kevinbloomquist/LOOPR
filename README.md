Welcome to LOOPR (working title alt: MOMENTum)

LOOPr is the foundation of a full-stack social app that allows users to communicate through multi-media messages called loops (or moments). When the code is fully mature a loop will be able to contain text, images, or an audio file. Unlike the messages in most contemporary social apps a loop is not received by the recipient immediately. In LOOPr the recipient will only receive a message when a trigger criteria is met. The two options for criteria are date & time or radius from a location. It is less of a social app then it is a new way to create and curate moments further connecting us to the present.


Ultimately a user should:
-be able to signup
-be able to login/logout
-be redirected to a "Present"page where they will see a feed of all triggered loops both authored and received
-be able to click a link that directs them to a future page where they will see all pending loops authored by them. Each with edit and delete icons
-be able to see and use an edit form that renders upon the click of the edit icon
-be able to delete a pending loop
-be able to return to the present page


Future functionality: live list
-loops can be commented on and liked by the author/recipient

Technologies used:

Working task list:

- clean up/ organize and finish RESTful and CRUD
- sort and satisfy API requirenent by getting location data and comparing to loops
- once edit and delete are functional work on fleshing out user and loop schema to be able to write trigger and sorting functionality
- TESTS!!!
- Style/ design/ UX/ and CSS (always be refning and iterating)
- DRY out code
